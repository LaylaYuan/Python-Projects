## Titanic

_Description_ 
The Titanic project develops algorithms to perform K-Means clustering on the Titanic passengers dataset in python.
The Titanic passengers dataset includes five attributes (Fare, Age, Sex, Companion Count, Embarked) to describe each
passenger and one target value ( Survive / Not Survive), the K-Means clustering aims to explore the relationship between 
the attributes and the survival by plotting one to one comparison.
